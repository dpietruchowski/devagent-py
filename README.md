# devagent-py

`devagent-py` is a code-writing assistant powered by GPT models.  
The code generated by the agent is saved inside the `src` directory.

You run the project with:

```bash
python main.py
```

and chat with the GPT model that generates code based on your commands.

The agent definition, including system prompt and configuration, is located in `lib/dev_agent.py`.

## Features

- Interactive assistant for code generation  
- Generated code is saved in the `src` folder  
- Two main commands available: `switch_model` — changes the active GPT model, and `commit` — automatically creates git commits  
- Modular tools definition — Python functions the agent can use  

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment:

~~~bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
~~~

Install dependencies:

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## Agent implementation

The `Agent` class, which wraps OpenAI communication, is implemented in `lib/agent.py`.

You define the agent by providing, among others:

- `system_prompt` — a context text that guides the agent’s behavior  
- `tools` — a list of Python functions the agent can call during its operation  

Each tool function should have a clear docstring explaining its purpose and parameters, for example:

```python
"""
Save content to a file. Use this function when the model wants to write text to a file.

:param file_path: The file path where the content should be saved.
:param content: The text content to write into the file.
"""
```

This helps the agent understand when and how to use these tools.

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

Chat with GPT, which will generate code inside the `src` directory.
